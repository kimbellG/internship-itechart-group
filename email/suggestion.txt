Hello Customer

I'm writing in connection with finding a new framework for processing the large amount of data.
I found the best one in my opinion and I am ready to offer "Name of Framework".

I suggested a new framework because our project needs to grow up in the speed of data processing.
This framework is what we need. He provides:
	* High-performance data pipelines.
	* Streaming analytics.
	* Data integration.
	* Mission-critical applications.
 
He will allow us:
	* To easily scale out project.
	* Get full analytics about status of application.
	* Speed up data processing several times.

I've looked through the feedback on the frameword ans it's very impressive(www.redit.com). 
They have got a full documantation and lagre users community. I've attached it.

I look forward to and early reply, and am sure that there is a good choice for out problem.

Hi

Out team doesn't have time to finish a new feature of our application due to the fact that a lot of time was spent
for testing and debugging
At the moment, 80% have been made. All basic function implemented, but we need little time to fully refine them.
I understand that if we do not fulfill the schedule, we will break the deadlines, but I'd be grateful if you could to extend the deadline for delivery 
for quality assurance.

I hope this clarifies the situationm, Artyom
